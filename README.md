All instructions to implement this weather app is in the workshop document that I curated myself, which is attached to this repository.

If you want to try out this code, you will need to add a file to this repository named index.ts in a directory named constants, which should be placed under the project's directory.

Insert this code in the index.ts file and replace inside the quotes "apiKey" with your api key from weatherAPI: 

export const apiKey = "**apiKey**";
